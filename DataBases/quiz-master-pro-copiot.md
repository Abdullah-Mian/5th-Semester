## Introduction

This project plan outlines the steps to combine your database course with your app development course, creating a robust Quiz Master Pro mobile application. This approach will maximize your learning and result in a strong portfolio piece.

## 1. Choosing the Database

While you're familiar with MySQL and MS SQL, consider exploring PostgreSQL for its advanced features and strong community support. Key points:

- Continue with MySQL or MS SQL if preferred
- PostgreSQL offers advanced features and is highly recommended for learning

## 2. Three-Tier Architecture

Implementing a three-tier architecture will improve scalability and maintainability:

1. **Presentation Tier**: User interface (Flutter mobile application)
2. **Application Tier**: Business logic (Backend framework like Node.js, Django, or Flask)
3. **Data Tier**: Database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MS SQL)

## 3. Migrating Your C++ Application

Steps to integrate SQL with your existing C++ application:

1. **Set up the Database**: 
   - Create tables for students, admins, departments, courses, and the question bank
2. **Connect C++ to SQL**: 
   - Use ODBC or MySQL Connector/C++ to establish connection
3. **Modify Data Operations**: 
   - Replace hardcoded data structures with SQL queries

## 4. Developing the Mobile Application in Flutter

Flutter integration steps:

1. **Set up Flutter**: 
   - Install and configure Flutter on your development machine
2. **Database Integration**: 
   - Use `sqflite` plugin for SQLite or set up a backend API
3. **Build the UI**: 
   - Design interfaces for login, quiz-taking, and results

## 5. Project Structure and Features

Core features to implement:

- **User Authentication**: Login functionality for students and admins
- **Quiz Management**: Admin tools for question management
- **Quiz Taking**: Student interface for quiz participation and result viewing
- **Course Management**: Course viewing and enrollment for students

## 6. Learning and Resources

Helpful documentation and tutorials:

- [Flutter Documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs)
- [PostgreSQL Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/)
- [C++ and SQL Integration Guide](https://www.codewithc.com/c-and-sql-integrating-database-operations/)

## 7. Future Enhancements

Consider adding these features after completing core functionality:

- **Real-time Quiz Updates**: Implement WebSockets for live question updates
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Provide admins with performance insights
- **Notifications**: Send push notifications for upcoming quizzes or new courses

This project will help you apply new technologies and create an impressive portfolio piece for potential employers.
