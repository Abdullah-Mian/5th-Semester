# 🐔 5th-Semester: A Repository of Blood, Sweat, and Burnt Out Brain Cells 😭🎓

---

## 📖 The Story

This repository isn’t just a collection of files. It’s a journey, a journey through countless late nights, infinite cups of chai, and the soul-sucking reality of academic deadlines. A lifeline, a beacon of hope in the dark abyss of 5th semester. It’s the difference between _surviving_ and _drowning_. And trust me, most of you look like you’re flailing.

Why did I create this?  
Because someone had to. Someone had to step up and say,  
**“If you dumbass chickens can’t even `git clone` a repo properly, I’m going to spoon-feed you every byte of knowledge.”**

I died a little inside..

So here it is. The **5th-Semester Repository**, meticulously organized, filled with everything you’ll need to survive this semester.

So, for all the dumbass chickens who can’t even `git clone` a repo properly,  
**this is your spoon-fed buffet of brilliance.**

| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **APP DEV** 📱               | A marvel of engineering featuring my semester project and tips to (barely) impress your professor.                                      |
| **COA LAB**⚙️                | Lab codes and hacks for Computer Organization (you’re welcome)                                                                          |
| **COA Theory** 💻            | Cheat sheets and notes you’ll inevitably cram the night before the exam.                                                                |

## 🔥 Special Highlights: Why This Repo is Legendary

### **Databases** 🗄️:

Here’s where the magic begins. Not only does this folder have your boring course content and lab codes, but it also contains my groundbreaking project:  
[**QuizMasterPro_WebEdition**](https://github.com/Abdullah-Mian/QuizMasterPro_WebEdition.git).

This isn’t just another “meh” assignment. It’s an **alternative for institutions** like ours, designed to stop your online quizzes from being robbed by a 2KB Chrome extension.

- Database Hosted on AWS.
- Frontend built with ReactJS.
- Backend powered by ExpressJS.

And the **UI/UX?** Don’t even get me started. It’s _chef’s kiss_. A development marvel that will make you question why your institution’s software still looks like it’s from 2002.

### **APP DEV** 📱:

Another folder of engineering brilliance. My semester project, [**CustomBot-Control**](https://github.com/Abdullah-Mian/CustomBot-Control.git), is here in all its glory.

This app isn’t just better than what’s on the Play Store—it’s **1,000 times better**.  
Aimed at assisting IoT projects, it’s about to go open-source and blow your minds.

Take a look. Seriously. I dare you to find a better alternative.

---

### **Operating Systems (OS)** 🖥️:

Ah, OS. The folder with your course content and my other _baby_: an **autonomous car project** powered by an ESP32.

Picture this:

- One thread reads ultrasonic sensors to avoid obstacles.
- Another thread drives the car, all smooth and smart-like.
- And together, they create a masterpiece of multithreaded genius.

It’s basically what Tesla _wishes_ they could do if they had an ESP32 and my brain.

## 😂 Why This Repo Exists

Let’s get real:

- To save **me** from answering the same questions a thousand times.
- To save **you** from aimlessly Googling, “How to pass 5th semester without studying.”
- To give our professors a tiny shred of sanity because they’ve **clearly** lost faith in humanity (thanks to our class).

And to ensure this class of mine—this beautiful, chaotic mix of brilliance and stupidity—makes it through this semester without dragging me down into the abyss of mediocrity.

Here’s the deal:  
If you’re still asking for links after reading this, congratulations. You’re the reason professors cry themselves to sleep.
