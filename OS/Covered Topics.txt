CPU consumptions I/O wait -- CPU utilization = (1 - P^n)

What is Kernel
-core part of an operating system
-bridge between applications and the physical hardware
-handling system resources like CPU, memory, and device management
-Prevents unauthorized access


Process Scheduling
-FCFS SJF non-preemptive
-SRTF RR preemptive

Response time = Start time -  Arrival time
T.A.T = Completion - arrival time 
Wait time =  T.A.T - Burst Time 


Pipes
-UnNamed Pipes for parent child communication
-Named Pipes for communication of random processes
